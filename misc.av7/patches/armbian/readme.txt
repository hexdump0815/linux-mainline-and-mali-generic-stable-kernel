those patches were taken from https://github.com/armbian/build at commit ced0c4a4e9c5adb4066302d6614c3e72112eb642

all credits for them go to the armbian team

only the more generic patches potentially relevant for the veyron chromebooks and the r89 tv box were taken

the "maybe" subdir of the armbian patches contains patches which could maybe be applied as well, but were not used for now

the "off" subdir of the armbian patches contains a patch which relies on rk3228 patches not used and is thus disabled

patches with a filename ending in ".org" were modified to make them patch properly and are around to see the changes done
